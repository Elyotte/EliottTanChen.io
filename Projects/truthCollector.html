                Truth Collector is a project I made in a small team of three people.
                As a Game Developper my task were to code the core mechanics in a way
                the other person working on the game could easily extend the content
                without me.
                The game used Godot .NET 3.5.2 and the built-in resources system to make an infinity of character possible.
